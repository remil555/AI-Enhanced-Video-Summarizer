# AI Enhanced Video Summarizer

## Overview

The AI Enhanced Video Summarizer is a web application developed using HTML and CSS. It seamlessly integrates YOLO for object detection and GPT for text generation to empower the website with the ability to generate summaries for input videos based on their context, enhancing user experience.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates YOLO for real-time object detection and GPT for text generation to create concise summaries for input videos.
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLO's advanced capabilities for real-time object detection within the input videos, ensuring accurate content analysis.
- **Coherent Text Generation**: Leverages GPT's proficiency in crafting coherent text to generate summaries that encapsulate the key points and context of the videos.
- **Effortless Upload and Analysis**: Enables users to effortlessly upload videos, triggering the website's algorithms to analyze the visual content and generate succinct summaries.
- **Enhanced Accessibility and Efficiency**: Provides users with informative summaries without the need to watch the entire video, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in consuming video content.

## Technologies Used

- YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for text generation

## Usage
1. **To run the model**: Run main.py file
1. **Upload Video**: Users can upload a video to the web application.
